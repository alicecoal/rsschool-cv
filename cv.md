## About me
I am 19 years old and I am currently studying at BSUIR. I think programming will allow me to fully realise my strengths: determination, the ability to work in a team and the ability to adapt to new circumstances. This course helps me self-develop and learn more about the field of front-end development, which gives endless opportunities to learn and self-actualize.

## Code example
*Task Nuclear Missile Manager from Codewars:* We are currently testing the nuclear missile manager system and the launchAll function should launch 5 missiles each 1 second apart. 
Note: There are 5 missiles labeled i which is a number in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The missile i should be launched after i seconds.
```
function launchAll(launchMissile) {
  for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(launchMissile,i*1000,i);
  }
}
```
